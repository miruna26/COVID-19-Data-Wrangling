# **COVID-19-Data-Wrangling**

This is a quick demo for wrangling Covid-19 Data obtained from different sources. 
Following a given schema, all the data feeds inside the **datasets** folder were processed in order to create a dashboard view. 

## **Programming language**

- Python & pandas 

## **How to use**
The solutions are saved in .ipynb format which allows you to run the code cell by cell and provides a better understanding of the steps performed.<br > <br /> 
For ease of access, I created a binder that allows the solutions to be run in a virtual environment. **Follow the link bellow!** <br > <br />

## **Solutions to ..**
### **1**:
- Perform data wrangling on the datasets
- Create a destination dataset that complies with the schema provided by the BI team

### **2**:
- output multiple files split by date 
- organise files in a directory structure that could be uploaded into hierarchical storage solution
- optimise access to data for time series analysis. 

### **3**:
- failure report that separately presents test results that are not valid or rejected from inclusion in the destination output dataset

## **Outputs**

The solutions results (organized datasets) are exported as .csv and can be viewed as follows: <br > <br />
-> **solutions_datasets** folder for **1** and **3** <br > <br /> -> **file_dates** for **2**
